			<div class="mission_statement_container">
				<p> We at Chess Club aim to cultivate an environment for chess-lovers <br>
				of all levels, ranging from total newcomers to 4+ year veterans. </p>
				<p> Fulfilling our group goal, Chess Club allows everyone to  <br>
				unwind and enjoy a friendly conversation over a stimulating chess match or two, <br>
				so if that interests you, try it out yourself! </p>
				<p> You'll be able to find us in MAC A (Mr. Marchant's room), where we'll host 
				regular lessons weekly and intra-club games daily at lunch (check calendar for details). </p>
