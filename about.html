		<div class="mission_statement_container">
			<p> We at WHS Chess Club aim to cultivate an environment for chess-lovers <br>
			of all levels, ranging from total newcomers to 4+ year veterans. </p>
			<p> In accordance with our group goal, Chess Club was made to allow everyone to  <br>
			unwind and enjoy a friendly conversation over a stimulating chess match or two, <br>
			so if that somewhat interests you, try it out for yourself! </p>
			<p> You can find us in MAC A, where we host regular lessons weekly and <br>
			intra-club games daily at lunch in MAC A (check calendar tab for details). </p>
 			<p> Thanks for your time. If you'd like to become a member, fill out this 3 question <br>
 			Google Form; if not, it's totally cool. make sure to drop in and say hi though! :D </p>
